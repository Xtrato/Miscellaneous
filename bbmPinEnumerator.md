BBM Pin Enumerator
===============
This script performs a  twitter search every 3 minutes for the search term “my bbm pin” and saves the pin into a results.txt file in the same folder.
I don’t know why people wouldn’t want to share their BBM pin with random people. I thought it was quite amusing nonetheless. You will need the Python-Twitter Wrapper for it to work.

You will need to enter your Twitter API information into line 5 for the querys to go through. The time between searches can be changed on line 30. By default it is set to 180 seconds.
